\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_bullet}{Bullet} \\*A bullet object is an entity that`s always moving in one direction }{\pageref{class_bullet}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_camera}{Camera} }{\pageref{class_camera}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_clickable_button}{Clickable\+Button} \\*A clickable button with text, animation and auto-\/resize to text width }{\pageref{class_clickable_button}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classcontrols_controller}{controls\+Controller} \\*Updates data from \hyperlink{classcontrols_handler}{controls\+Handler} to \hyperlink{classcontrols_input}{controls\+Input} }{\pageref{classcontrols_controller}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_controls_controller}{Controls\+Controller} }{\pageref{class_controls_controller}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classcontrols_handler}{controls\+Handler} \\*Handles retrieving the data from hardware inputs }{\pageref{classcontrols_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_controls_handler}{Controls\+Handler} }{\pageref{class_controls_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classcontrols_input}{controls\+Input} \\*Struct with saves states of hardware inputs }{\pageref{classcontrols_input}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_controls_input}{Controls\+Input} }{\pageref{struct_controls_input}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_crate}{Crate} \\*\hyperlink{class_crate}{Crate} class Contains the crate graphic and overrides the necessary functions from \hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity} }{\pageref{class_crate}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_credits_state}{Credits\+State} \\*The gamestate that shows the credits screen }{\pageref{class_credits_state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_cursor}{Cursor} \\*Class for the \hyperlink{class_cursor}{Cursor} entity. Overrides the needed functions from \hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity}. Places a sprite on the cursor location }{\pageref{class_cursor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_enemy}{Enemy} \\*Handles enemy movement, interaction and art. The enemy class creates an instance of an enemy and adds the position given as waypoint. If other waypoints are added, which are first in line, we set entity position to that waypoint. Once all waypoints are added (map is looped through entirely) we create a queue from this map of waypoints. If we only have 1 waypoint we empty our queue and stand still. If we have an even amount, we loop through those points. If the amount of waypoints is uneven, we create a line instead }{\pageref{class_enemy}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity} }{\pageref{class_entity}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classentity_controller}{entity\+Controller} \\*\hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity} class This class represents any entity in the game. It contains information about its position, size and whether it\textquotesingle{}s solid or not. It also has a function to change the position, a pure virtual update function and a function to determine collision via axis-\/aligned bounding boxes }{\pageref{classentity_controller}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_entity_controller}{Entity\+Controller} \\*Contains instances of every entity, including player and background. This class contains instances of every entity. It has a function to update positions of every entity, including player, taking collision into account. It also has a \hyperlink{class_entity_controller_a82e17378b1553449be6f93a8c18eefee}{draw()} function to draw all entities at once. Furthermore, it contains 4 vectors to determine direction, to be built into a seperate class }{\pageref{class_entity_controller}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_exit}{Exit} \\*Invisible wall which handles \textquotesingle{}exiting\textquotesingle{} a level. The wall contains a number representing the level to advance to. It uses standard A\+A\+B\+B-\/collision detection to determine if our player collides. The exit number is saved in the state and read by EC to determine where to exit to }{\pageref{class_exit}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_game_loop_object}{Game\+Loop\+Object} \\*The base class for all objects used in a game loop }{\pageref{class_game_loop_object}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_game_state}{Game\+State} \\*The base class for all gamestates }{\pageref{class_game_state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_game_state_manager}{Game\+State\+Manager} \\*The game\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_game_state_manager}{Game\+State\+Manager}. Handles most of the game loop }{\pageref{class_game_state_manager}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_graphic}{Graphic} \\*Creates a graphic object }{\pageref{class_graphic}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_highscores_state}{Highscores\+State} \\*The gamestate that shows the (unimplemented) high scores }{\pageref{class_highscores_state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_hud}{Hud} \\*Creates a hud overlay with the following\+: }{\pageref{class_hud}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_item}{Item} \\*\hyperlink{class_item}{Item} is a entity that can modify the stats }{\pageref{class_item}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_level_manager}{Level\+Manager} \\*Works together with the \hyperlink{class_playing_state}{Playing\+State} to handle maps, entities and music }{\pageref{class_level_manager}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_main_menu_state}{Main\+Menu\+State} \\*The gamestate that is the game\textquotesingle{}s main menu }{\pageref{class_main_menu_state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_map}{Map} \\*Creates an entity list based on a collision map This class creates a list of entities based on the red value of a .png-\/file. We loop through the pixels to determine a position. The tile size is constant and set. Once we find a pixel with a red-\/value of 0, we make it our spawnpoint. If it\textquotesingle{}s a 1, we spawn a wall at that position with the standard tilesize and add it to the entity list. A red-\/value of 2 indicates an enemy waypoint. This will either create a new enemy from that waypoint, or add the waypoint to an already existing enemy. In creating such a waypoint, the green-\/value of the pixel determines the enemy by ID and the blue-\/value determines the order of waypoints. In that way, we only have to loop through the pixel map once. A red-\/value of 3 is a crate, and a red-\/value of 4 is a set of spikes. In this case, the green value represents the starting state (down, rising or up). Finally a red-\/value of 5 represents an exit, with its green-\/value being the level number (1-\/based!) }{\pageref{class_map}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_menu}{Menu} \\*A auto-\/resizing menu of Clickable\+Buttons }{\pageref{class_menu}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player} \\*Handles player movement, interaction, animations and art }{\pageref{class_player}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_player_stats}{Player\+Stats} \\*Struct that contains player statistics }{\pageref{struct_player_stats}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_playing_state}{Playing\+State} \\*The gamestate handling all gameplay }{\pageref{class_playing_state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_spike}{Spike} \\*Set of spikes which protrude and retract based on a timer. A set of spikes which change states every 1/2th second. The initial state is given with our constructor, and pulled from the map by green value. The player is also given as a reference to be able to call the Trigger\+Death() function }{\pageref{class_spike}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_timer}{Timer} }{\pageref{struct_timer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_title_screen_state}{Title\+Screen\+State} \\*The gamestate that shows the title screen. The first thing the player sees }{\pageref{class_title_screen_state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_turret}{Turret} \\*\hyperlink{class_turret}{Turret} that shoots bullets in a certain direction. This turret is created with a direction in our map, as well as the amount of frames between each shot. The bullets themselves are shot from EC, with the shot timer being contained inside this class. The turret sets a public boolean to true when it is time to shoot and sets it to false. This way, EC can read out the boolean to shoot a bullet }{\pageref{class_turret}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classvision_bullet}{vision\+Bullet} \\*Invisible bullets to detect enemy vision }{\pageref{classvision_bullet}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_wall}{Wall} \\*(invisible) \hyperlink{class_wall}{Wall} class This class represents an invisible wall-\/tile. Its position is a multitude of (32,32) and its size is exactly (32,32). It cannot update, since our position is always set, and it cannot draw, because it is invisible. So we override those functions with empty brackets }{\pageref{class_wall}}{}
