\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \hyperlink{class_map}{Map}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Creates an entity list based on a collision map This class creates a list of entities based on the red value of a .png-\/file. We loop through the pixels to determine a position. The tile size is constant and set. Once we find a pixel with a red-\/value of 0, we make it our spawnpoint. If it\textquotesingle{}s a 1, we spawn a wall at that position with the standard tilesize and add it to the entity list. A red-\/value of 2 indicates an enemy waypoint. This will either create a new enemy from that waypoint, or add the waypoint to an already existing enemy. In creating such a waypoint, the green-\/value of the pixel determines the enemy by ID and the blue-\/value determines the order of waypoints. In that way, we only have to loop through the pixel map once. A red-\/value of 3 is a crate, and a red-\/value of 4 is a set of spikes. In this case, the green value represents the starting state (down, rising or up). Finally a red-\/value of 5 represents an exit, with its green-\/value being the level number (1-\/based!) \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
